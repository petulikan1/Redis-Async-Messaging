# Redis-Async-Messaging

**Redis-Async-Messaging** is a Java library designed to handle Redis messages asynchronously. By leveraging Redis's publish-subscribe (pub/sub) capabilities, this library enables efficient and non-blocking message processing in Java applications.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Utilizes Java's concurrency features to process Redis messages without blocking the main thread.
- **Integration with Redis Pub/Sub**: Seamlessly integrates with Redis's pub/sub mechanism for real-time message distribution.
- **Customizable Message Handling**: Allows developers to define custom handlers for different message channels.
